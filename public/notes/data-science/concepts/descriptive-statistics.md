# Descriptive Statistics

## Concept Overview

Descriptive Statistics uses statistical indicators and visualization methods to summarize and describe the main characteristics of data.

## Core Indicators

Main indicators of descriptive statistics include:

### Central Tendency
- **Mean** - Average level of data
- **Median** - Middle value of data
- **Mode** - Most frequently occurring value

### Dispersion
- **Variance** - Degree of data fluctuation
- **Standard Deviation** - Square root of variance
- **Interquartile Range** - Distribution range of data

## Relationships with Other Concepts

Descriptive statistics is a fundamental tool for [[what-is-data-science]] analysis.

It is commonly used in the [[data-cleaning]] stage to help identify outliers and data quality issues.

Descriptive statistics is closely related to [[probability-basics]] and lays the foundation for inferential statistics.

Understanding data distribution is important for feature transformation in [[feature-engineering]].

## Visualization Methods

(This section will be refined in future updates)

- Histograms
- Box plots
- Scatter plots
- Heatmaps
