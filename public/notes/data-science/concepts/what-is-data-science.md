# What is Data Science

## Concept Overview

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract valuable insights and knowledge from data.

## Core Components

Data science includes three core components:

1. **Data Processing Capabilities** - Ability to collect, clean, and process large-scale data
2. **Statistical Analysis Capabilities** - Using statistical methods to understand data patterns
3. **Domain Knowledge** - Applying analysis results to real-world problems

## Relationships with Other Concepts

To begin learning data science, you first need to understand how to perform [[problem-framing]], that is, how to transform real-world problems into data science problems.

The core workflow of data science includes [[data-collection]], [[data-cleaning]], and [[feature-engineering]].

To deeply understand data science, you also need to master foundational knowledge such as [[descriptive-statistics]] and [[probability-basics]].

## Learning Recommendations

(This section will be refined in future updates)

- Build a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics
- Learn programming (Python/R)
- Practice through real projects
