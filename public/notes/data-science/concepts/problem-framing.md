# Problem Framing

## Concept Overview

Problem Framing is the process of transforming business problems into technical problems that can be solved using data science methods. This is the crucial first step for successful data science projects.

## Why It Matters

Many data science projects fail not because of technical issues, but because problems were not correctly defined. Good problem framing can:

- Clarify goals and success criteria
- Determine what data is needed
- Select appropriate analysis methods

## Relationships with Other Concepts

Problem framing is the starting point of the [[what-is-data-science]] workflow.

Once a problem is correctly defined, the next step is [[data-collection]], gathering data needed to solve the problem.

The type of problem (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) affects subsequent [[supervised-learning]] method selection.

## Problem Framing Framework

(This section will be refined in future updates)

1. Understand business context
2. Identify stakeholders
3. Define success metrics
4. Identify constraints
