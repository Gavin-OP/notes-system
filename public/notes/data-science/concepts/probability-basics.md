# Probability Basics

## Concept Overview

Probability is a mathematical tool for quantifying uncertainty and is the foundation for understanding and building statistical models.

## Core Concepts

Fundamental concepts of probability theory include:

- **Random Events** - Events that may or may not occur
- **Probability Space** - Set of all possible outcomes
- **Conditional Probability** - Probability of an event occurring under certain conditions
- **Independence** - Whether events influence each other
- **Bayes' Theorem** - Updating probabilities based on new information

## Common Probability Distributions

- Discrete distributions: Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution
- Continuous distributions: Normal distribution, Exponential distribution

## Relationships with Other Concepts

Probability theory builds upon [[descriptive-statistics]].

Probability concepts are key to understanding many algorithms in [[supervised-learning]], especially Bayesian methods and probabilistic graphical models.

Probability theory helps us understand the mathematical principles behind [[overfitting-underfitting]].

In [[model-selection]], we use probabilistic methods to assess model uncertainty.

## Application Scenarios

(This section will be refined in future updates)

- A/B testing
- Risk assessment
- Predictive modeling
- Hypothesis testing
