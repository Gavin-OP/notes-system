# Data Collection

## Concept Overview

Data Collection is the process of acquiring raw data for analysis. Data quality directly affects the effectiveness of subsequent analysis.

## Data Sources

Common data sources include:

- **Databases** - Structured data within enterprises
- **APIs** - Data interfaces provided by third-party services
- **Web Scraping** - Public data scraped from websites
- **Sensors** - Real-time data generated by IoT devices
- **Surveys** - Primary data collected through questionnaires

## Relationships with Other Concepts

Data collection is based on requirements determined through [[problem-framing]].

Raw collected data usually needs to be cleaned through [[data-cleaning]] before it can be used for analysis.

The quality of data collection affects the effectiveness of [[feature-engineering]] and the performance of final [[model-selection]].

## Important Considerations

(This section will be refined in future updates)

- Data privacy and compliance
- Representativeness of data sampling
- Data version management
